## Project Description
We are building a privacy-preserving NFT platform that uses zero-knowledge proofs to protect user data and transaction details.

The core problem we address is that current NFT systems expose wallet addresses and ownership history publicly, which compromises user privacy and makes digital identity traceable.

Our solution introduces a ZK-based protocol where NFTs can be minted, transferred, or gifted without revealing the owner's address or linking any personal identifiers. This ensures complete encryption, anonymity, and trust in NFT ownership and exchange, allowing creators and collectors to interact securely without sacrificing privacy.



## Tech Stack
- Solidity
- Circom
- Next.js
- Foundry
- ZKIT


## Objectives
By the end of ARG25 Invisible Garden, my goal is to deeply understand Zero-Knowledge Proofs, both the math behind them and their practical implementation, and to build an NFT protocol that is fully decentralized, encrypted, and privacy-preserving.

The outcome I’m aiming for is a prototype where NFT ownership and transfers are verified through ZKPs, without exposing any private data on-chain, combining cryptographic integrity with real Web3 decentralization.


## Weekly Progress

### Week 1 (ends Oct 31)
**Goals:**
- Propose the core idea and explore key aspects of using ZKPs for NFT privacy
- Define the technologies and initial approach based on our current ZKP knowledge.

**Progress Summary:**  
- All initial goals were successfully achieved. The team defined the project’s core concept, analyzed key aspects of implementing ZKPs for NFT privacy, and selected the technologies to be used in development.


### Week 2 (ends Nov 7)
